# Designing and Building Custom Apps using Dynamics 365 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Designing and Building Custom Apps using Dynamics 365 [Video]] (https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/getting-started-reactive-programming-kotlin-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789130829), published by [Packt] (https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
	Reactive programming has become a trend for software companies, especially if they have services used by thousands of users in the cloud. Using asynchronous computation when deploying into the cloud is a must-have, as companies are billed by the second for CPU power. <br/>
As a developer, you can write asynchronous code, but scaling problems and keeping control of concurrency makes it very challenging. It reduces the complexity of writing async code by using the functional programming paradigm. This allows you to write code in a manageable way with a high level of abstractions, making nested callbacks a thing of the past. <br/>
In this practical course, you’ll first learn how to view problems in a reactive way, and then build programs that leverage the best features of this exciting new programming paradigm. You’ll then begin with the general concepts of reactive programming and then gradually move on to working with asynchronous data streams. You’ll dive into advanced techniques such as customizing operators and providers and see how to use the concurrency model to control the asynchronicity of code and process event handlers effectively. You’ll also explore Coroutines, another exciting topic. <br/>
By the end of this course, you’ll be able to bring these reactive programming techniques into play by writing code with reduced complexity, a high level of abstraction, and increased efficiency.
